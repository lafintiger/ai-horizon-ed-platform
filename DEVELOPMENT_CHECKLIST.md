## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Integration
```python
# Connect to main AI-Horizon database
main_db_path = config.get('MAIN_PLATFORM_DB_URL')
# Query analysis_results table for latest findings
# Extract emerging skills data for educational curation
```

### API Key Requirements
```bash
# Required for full functionality
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key_here
GITHUB_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Optional for enhanced features  
COURSERA_API_KEY=your_key_here
UDEMY_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: Main platform connection
3. **API Tests**: Resource discovery endpoints
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow from skills → resources

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Technical Milestones
- [ ] Skills extracted from main platform with >90% accuracy
- [ ] Resource discovery finds relevant content for identified skills
- [ ] Learning paths auto-generate based on workforce intelligence
- [ ] Web interface loads in <2 seconds
- [ ] Integration syncs every 6 hours automatically

### User Experience Goals
- [ ] Students find resources for priority skills within 24 hours of identification
- [ ] Learning paths align with industry demand predictions
- [ ] Interface maintains consistent look/feel with main AI-Horizon platform
- [ ] Progress tracking motivates continued learning

## 📚 Key Resources

- **Main Platform Database**: `../data/content.db`
- **Analysis Scripts**: `../scripts/analysis/` (for reference)
- **Main Platform Templates**: `../templates/` (for styling consistency)
- **Quality Ranking**: `../scripts/analysis/implement_quality_ranking.py`

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Database Connection**: Ensure main platform database path is correct
2. **API Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting for YouTube/GitHub APIs
3. **Skill Extraction**: Parse JSON data carefully from analysis_results
4. **Styling Consistency**: Import CSS from main platform for consistent look
