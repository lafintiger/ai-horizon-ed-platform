# AI-Horizon Ed Development Checklist

## üö® **CRITICAL: PRE-DEMO PROTOCOL**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **ALWAYS CHECK DATABASE FIRST** - *Learned the Hard Way*
Before ANY demo or presentation:

1. **üîç VERIFY DATABASE STATUS**: `curl https://ai-horizon-ed-platform-50ef91ff7701.herokuapp.com/api/database/stats`
2. **‚ö° EMERGENCY RESTORE IF EMPTY**: Available via `/emergency-restore` or `/emergency-restore-full`
3. **üéØ VERIFY CORE RESOURCES**: Check skill detail pages show resources
4. **üöÄ CONFIRM FUNCTIONALITY**: Test skill detail pages and dashboard

**The educational resources ARE the money shot - everything else is secondary!**

## üéâ **LATEST UPDATE: July 2, 2025 - MAJOR RESTORATION & ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE**

### ‚úÖ **CRISIS RESOLVED: Complete Database Restoration System**
- **Issue**: Previous emergency restore only added 2 sample resources (causing panic!)
- **Solution**: Built comprehensive restoration system that preserves ALL work
- **Result**: ‚úÖ **62 resources** and **7 skills** successfully restored to Heroku

### üöÄ **NEW FEATURES ADDED TODAY:**
1. **Complete Database Restoration**:
   - `/emergency-restore-full` endpoint accepts full database exports
   - `heroku_full_restore.py` script exports all local data to Heroku
   - Preserves skill-resource mappings and quality scores
   
2. **Enhanced Skill Portfolio**:
   - **NEW**: Prompt Engineering skill (21 local resources, subset online)
   - **ENHANCED**: Quantum-Safe Cryptography with foundational resources
   - **IMPROVED**: All skill pages now properly accessible
   
3. **Advanced Content Mapping Algorithm**:
   - Intelligent keyword-based resource categorization
   - Quality control to prevent wrong content mapping
   - Precision matching with negative keyword filtering
