# AI-Horizon Ed Development Checklist

## üö® **CRITICAL: PRE-DEMO PROTOCOL**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **ALWAYS CHECK DATABASE FIRST** - *Learned the Hard Way*
Before ANY demo or presentation:

1. **üîç VERIFY DATABASE STATUS**: `curl https://ed.theaihorizon.org/api/database/stats`
2. **‚ö° EMERGENCY RESTORE IF EMPTY**: Run `./scripts/emergency_restore.sh`
3. **üéØ VERIFY CORE RESOURCES**: Check Vibe Coding page has content
4. **üöÄ CONFIRM FUNCTIONALITY**: Test skill detail pages show resources

**The educational resources ARE the money shot - everything else is secondary!**
