# AI-Horizon Educational Resources System

> **🎓 A comprehensive platform for discovering, collecting, and recommending educational resources for AI skills development**

## 📋 Overview

The AI-Horizon Educational Resources System is a **completely separate** project from the workforce intelligence system. It focuses on helping students and faculty find, organize, and track educational resources (videos, articles, tutorials, tools) for AI and cybersecurity skills development.

## 🎯 Core Purpose

Unlike the workforce intelligence system that analyzes job market trends, this system is designed to:

- **Discover** educational content from multiple sources (YouTube, online courses, documentation)
- **Organize** resources by skill category, difficulty level, and learning paths
- **Recommend** personalized learning resources based on user preferences
- **Track** learning progress and completion
- **Curate** high-quality educational content collections

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 Resource Discovery
- Multi-source search: YouTube, online courses, documentation, tutorials

- Real-time content discovery: Fresh educational content identification

### 📚 Learning Paths
- Structured curricula: Step-by-step learning sequences
- Skill prerequisites: Dependency tracking for learning progression
- Difficulty progression: Beginner to expert pathways

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.12, Flask 3.0
- **Database**: SQLite (Educational resources, user progress, preferences)
- **AI Services**: OpenAI, Anthropic (Content analysis & recommendations)
- **Content APIs**: YouTube API, Course platforms

## 🔒 Separation from Workforce Intelligence

This system is **completely independent** from the AI-Horizon workforce intelligence system:

- **Different databases**: Educational resources vs. job market data
- **Different APIs**: Content discovery vs. workforce analysis  
- **Different users**: Students/faculty vs. workforce analysts
- **Different deployment**: Separate servers and configurations
