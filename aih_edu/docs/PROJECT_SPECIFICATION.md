# AI-Horizon Ed: Intelligent Educational Resource Curation Platform
## Project Specification v3.1 - Production Operational Status

### Project Overview

**AI-Horizon Ed** is a **FULLY OPERATIONAL** educational platform that transforms workforce intelligence into curated learning resources. The platform successfully bridges the gap between emerging industry skills and educational content discovery.

**🚀 Live Platform**: https://ai-horizon-ed-platform-50ef91ff7701.herokuapp.com/  
**🔧 Admin Panel**: https://ai-horizon-ed-platform-50ef91ff7701.herokuapp.com/admin  
**📁 GitHub**: https://github.com/lafintiger/ai-horizon-ed-platform

### Core Mission ✅ ACHIEVED & OPERATIONAL
Transform workforce intelligence into actionable learning experiences by:
- ✅ **Identifying emerging skills** in cybersecurity (5 skills implemented)
- ✅ **Discovering educational resources** automatically (55+ high-quality resources)
- ✅ **AI-powered quality assessment** using Claude/OpenAI
- ✅ **Comprehensive admin interface** for skill and resource management
- ✅ **Professional web interface** with responsive design
- ✅ **Enhanced learning experience** with AI-generated content and progress tracking

### 🎯 RECENT CRITICAL FIXES (July 2025)

#### Data Structure Resolution - All Systems Operational
**Issues Resolved**:
1. **Skills Overview Page**: Fixed `'dict object' has no attribute 'skill_name'` by flattening data structure
2. **Skill Detail Pages**: Resolved `'list object' has no attribute 'items'` template mismatch  
3. **Template Safety**: Fixed `'None' has no attribute 'replace'` errors with defensive coding

**Result**: All pages now render correctly with proper data flow from database → Flask routes → Jinja2 templates.

## 2. SKILLS INTELLIGENCE INTEGRATION

### 2.1 Data Sources from Main AI-Horizon Platform
**Pull from main platform's analysis results:**

```python
# Integration points with main AI-Horizon
MAIN_PLATFORM_SOURCES = {
    'trend_analysis': 'scripts/analysis/trend_analysis.py results',
    'ai_adoption_predictions': 'scripts/analysis/ai_adoption_predictions.py results', 
    'skills_gap_analysis': 'Custom analysis of job postings for emerging skills',
    'category_narratives': 'Comprehensive category analysis results',
    'job_market_sentiment': 'Real-time sentiment analysis of cybersecurity roles'
}
```

### 2.2 Skill Extraction Pipeline
```python
# Extract emerging skills from main platform findings
class SkillIntelligenceExtractor:
    def extract_emerging_skills(self) -> List[str]:
        """Extract list of emerging skills from main platform analysis"""
        # Pull from main AI-Horizon database analysis_results table
        # Parse trend_analysis for "emerging" skills
        # Parse ai_adoption_predictions for "future-critical" competencies
        # Return prioritized list of skills for educational resource search
        
    def identify_skill_gaps(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Identify skills with highest demand vs. availability gap"""
        # Analyze job market data for supply/demand mismatches
        # Return skill gaps with urgency scores
        
    def get_skill_priorities(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get prioritized skills with context and urgency"""
        # Combine emerging skills + skill gaps + trend momentum
        # Return structured skill priority list for resource curation
```

## 3. EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE DISCOVERY

### 3.1 Automated Resource Search
**Based on emerging skills identified by main platform:**

```python
# Resource discovery for each emerging skill
class ResourceDiscoveryEngine:
    def search_youtube_content(self, skill: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Search YouTube for educational videos on emerging skill"""
        # YouTube Data API search for tutorials, courses
        # Filter for quality content (view count, ratings, recency)
        # Extract metadata (duration, difficulty, creator credibility)
        
    def search_online_courses(self, skill: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Find online courses and certifications"""
        # Search Coursera, edX, Udemy APIs for relevant courses
        # Prioritize industry-recognized certifications
        # Include free and paid options
        
    def discover_tools_software(self, skill: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Find relevant tools and software for skill development"""
        # GitHub API for popular repositories and tools
        # Software discovery for hands-on practice platforms
        # Include both free and enterprise tools
        
    def curate_documentation(self, skill: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Find official documentation and technical resources"""
        # Search for official docs, whitepapers, technical guides
        # Prioritize vendor documentation and industry standards
```

### 3.2 Content Quality Assessment
**Inherit quality ranking from main platform:**

```python
# Reuse main platform's quality assessment approach
from scripts.analysis.implement_quality_ranking import DocumentQualityRanker

class EducationalContentRanker(DocumentQualityRanker):
    def rank_educational_content(self, content: Dict) -> float:
        """Rank educational content with learning-specific criteria"""
        # Adapt main platform's quality scoring for educational context
        # Consider: recency, credibility, comprehensiveness, engagement
        # Return 0.0-1.0 quality score for educational resources
```
